# Common Char

Topic: `java, stringbuilder`

### Overview:

*   This program asks a user for two strings, and displays the number of common characters that the
two strings share.

### Step-by-step

*   Import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package.
    *   Create a Scanner object that reads from system input. 
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class commonChar {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
  Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);
  // do something
  }
}
```
